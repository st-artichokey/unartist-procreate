# Gestures

With a limited screen size, learning these hand gestures will help you with your speed and ease of use. They are also something to be aware of if you are not using a stylus as it is possible to accidentally do them with your hand. 

## Undo and Redo

To undo an action, tap with two fingers on the screen. You will see a note at the top of the image box that says `Undo (whatever you just did)`.

To redo an action, tap with three fingers on teh screen. As above, you will receive feedback `Redo (whatever you just did)`.

## Pinch and Zoom

Procreate pocket uses the pinch and zoom gestures that are common for phone users. Touch the screen with two fingers, bringing them together or separating them to zoom in or zoom out. You can also use these fingers to  rotate the image.

This behavior can be done in any mode but be careful when using the adjustment (arrow) tool to use two fingers and not one as this can transform your image instead of change the view.
