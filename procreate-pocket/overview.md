# Procreate Pocket Overview

Procreate Pocket is the version of the Procreate app for phone. Although it has fewer features than the iPad version, it is still a handy digital art, photo editing, and animation app.

Note: as of this writing, I am using an iPhone 16 Pro Max with Procreate Pocket version 4.0.12.

## Peripherals

Since the Apple Pencil (v1 and v2) do not work with the phone iOS, getting a stylus that works with the phone was helpful. I tried a couple styles and found I preferred the ones with the pencil tip versus the ones with the disc tip. This was less due to the functionality of the pen itself, but more because it made it hard to see what I was doing on the smaller screen. If the disc tip doesnâ€™t bother you, then it shouldn't matter much which stylus you use.

You can also use your finger to draw but I much prefer the precision of a stylus. I also found it useful to have more than one stylus since I inevitably lost them in my house.
