# How to Pet Portrait

If you have ever wanted to put your pet's photo on a work of art (historical, creative commons, etc), this walkthrough is for you. Unlike the original painting, no deep understanding of art is needed and, given the right tools, you can even do this on your phone.

I personally I started these types of projects when I realized that it was easier to digitally add a costume to my cat than to try to get him into one. The result is just as cute (if not more so) and neither one of us has to suffer.

You will need the following for this project:

- picture of your pet
- historical portrait
- digital art/photo editing software. I use Procreate on the iPad, although you can also use Procreate Pocket on your phone
- stylus for the above (I use the apple pencil, but whatever stylus you use for your device is fine)

## The Portrait

I tend to use historical paintings for this and in the past have used one of [Vlad the Impaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler#/media/File:Vlad_Ţepeş,_the_Impaler,_Prince_of_Wallachia_(1456-1462)_(died_1477).jpg), Henry VII, [Louis XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV#/media/File:Anonyme_-_Portrait_du_Dauphin_01.jpg), and [Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraits_of_Mozart#/media/File:W_a_mozart.jpg). The last one is the one I used as the subject of this walkthrough.

Wikipedia has a great selection of historical portraits from the public domain and I recommend using those. A lot of the images returned from image searches online are not in the public domain and may be subject to copyright for various reasons.

Portraits of the subject from the torso up are typically the best for this type of art. This is to a degree my own personal preference because I feel like cats with human limbs are creepy. Your mileage and purpose may vary.

## Your Pet's Photo

Once you have the portrait you want to use, find a photo of your pet where both your pet and the subject of the portrait are looking in the same or a similar direction. If your pet and the person are looking in opposite directions (or are quarter profile vs full profile, for example), the picture will look less natural and more like you taped your pet into a historical painting.

Next when selecting your pet picture, you will want a higher resolution photo that is clear and not blurry. The higher the resolution the better, although most phone cameras these days will do the job.

Try to get a good shot of your pet's entire head and chest with good lighting. You don't need studio lighting or anything fancy, but if the image is too dark, it will be harder to incorporate into most portraits. Make sure their entire head is in the photo as you will likely want to have their entire cute face in the portrait, including ears (if they have them).

The photo should be in focus. Blurry photos or action shots won't work for this. Taking an in-focus photo may be difficult as some pets don't like their photo being taken, so a bribe for this part of the process is a good idea [^1].

You will also want to get a photo with just your pet in it if possible. I use the [iPhone's subject lift](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/lift-a-subject-from-the-photo-background-iphfe4809658/ios) to extract the photo of my pet. It tends to grab the image I want pretty well and exclude background image clutter, making the photo editing process much easier. However, if there is another human or pet in the photo, it will typically lift them as well.

If you don't use or don't have access to this tool or a similar one that's ok. It just means a bit more work later on but won't be a blocker for this project. 

## Portrait Plus Pet

Now that you have a photo of your pet and the portrait you want to use, it's time to start the art. 

The painting I selected for this project was this painting of [Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraits_of_Mozart#/media/File:W_a_mozart.jpg)

The photo I selected of my pet was one where he was looking in the same general direction as Mozart. He was at the vet, so he also had a similarly concerned look.

If you aren't using the abovementioned iPhone lift-share technology, or don't have an iphone, don't worry. This technology makes it easier to do this, but is not requrired. You can also just trim out the part of the image that has your pet and work with that.

Add the portrait to the canvas size you want (I typically use 4x6 with 300 DPI). Then, add the picture as a separate layer. In Procreate this is `add -> insert a photo`. This is only if you have the images in your camera roll, if not you will use the `insert a file` option for wherever you have the images stored.

Trim out any excess background from your pet photo and adjust the pet image so that it fits over the face of in the portrait.

Next, trim the pet image to only the parts you will need. I use a monoline eraser brush for the larger cleanup, then do a detail erase with a clean sketch brush. This gives the edges a texture that will make it easier to blend into the portrait.

After you get the general shape of the pet image set, you'll want to start fitting it into the portrait. First, I use the clean sketch brush for the edges. Once I get the edges mostly trimmed down to where I want them, I use a short hair brush to blend the edge so it is less harsh. This doesn't need to be perfect as you will tidy this up later.

Next, you will duplicate the layer with the portrait and move it above the layer with the pet photo. Remove the parts of the portrait's face you don't need for your pet photo. For example, this is how I got the wig over the cat's ear, which makes the photo look more realistic. This also works for hats, jewelry, or other headpieces you might want to incorporate from the portrait.

![Step four, add overlay](/procreate-ipad/Assets/cat-portrait-gifs/4-add-overlayer.GIF)

Finally, the original shape of the portrait may not be the size of the canvas you selected. To fix this, I cut and pasted the top part of the portrait several times. Then I flipped each pasted layer a different direction, which gave me enough of the painting edge texture to work with. With each layer, I blend and erase the edges until I feel like I've reached a similar texture to the original painting.

There's no need to use a particular brush for this. I use whatever brush works to blend the painting style. For the portrait you selected, try out a couple blend and erase brushes until you get it looking the way you want it to. I tend to use the paintbrush-type brushes but sometimes brushes like concrete-texture are also helpful.

If this doesn't give you the look you want, you can also just add a solid color border.

And then you're done! Congratulations on adding your pet to a historical painting. I'm sure it's adorable. Mine is.

[^1]: Pets like dogs and cats can see the infrared light that phone cameras use to focus. So if they aren't used to it, the light will appear bright and uncomfortable. I suggest treats and telling them they are a good boy/girl/etc as a means of recompensing them for this experience. My cat Norman loves attention and has come to associate picture time with attention time. He is a good boy and gets many scritches.
