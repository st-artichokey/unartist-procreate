# The Un-Artist's Guide to Procreate

This guide has two sections: one for [Procreate Pocket](https://procreate.com/pocket) on iPhone and one for [Procreate](https://procreate.com) on iPad. I started on iPhone, so feel free to start there as well.

This is an unofficial guide with much gratitude to the welcoming and helpful Procreate community and to those blogs who have provided amazing walkthroughs and how-tos.

This repo does not represent the official guides available for Procreate and are intended for hobby use only.

## Why Un-Artist's?

As a self-taught artist, I've found that there aren't a lot of guides to the very basic questions I had when using new software. Even though Procreate is a user-friendly system, there were still some things that I feel took too long for me to figure out.
